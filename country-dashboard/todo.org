** Data
   I also noticed that the numbers seem off. I checked Russia/Ukraine
   that tend to reach a top of ~20% of activity, and they have much lower
   numbers in the chart. Similarly, Algeria, with activity ~1% to 2% seem
   to have higher numbers. I attach the Excel Spreadsheet with the
   correct data for the % of workers that are active from each country.
** Load time
   I also noticed that the chart took a long time to load. Is there a way
   to have a "percent loaded" counter? I could not quite understand if my
   browser was crashed or if my connection was too slow, etc. and I was
   ready to give up, until the visualization loaded.
